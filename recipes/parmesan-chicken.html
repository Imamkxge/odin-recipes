    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>I came up with this recipe when I had no bread crumbs but had Parmesan cheese.</p> 
    <p>I decided to try olive oil instead of egg to dip the chicken in. I love how the cheese melted down over the chicken and it had a wonderful flavor. </p>
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>8 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DIRECTION</h4>

        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with foil</li>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <li>Put olive oil in a shallow bowl. Mix together Parmesan cheese, celery salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder in another shallow bowl.</li>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <li><p>Cut chicken thighs in half. Dip chicken pieces in olive oil so both sides are covered, then press one side in the Parmesan mixture until coated.</p><p> Place on the prepared pan with the coating facing up.</p></li>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes.</p><p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
